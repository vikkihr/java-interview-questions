            <h2>1. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?</h2>
            <p>Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time, whereas unchecked exceptions are those that occur at runtime. Checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in the method signature, while unchecked exceptions do not have this requirement.</p>

            <h2>2. What is the purpose of the `finally` block?</h2>
            <p>The `finally` block in Java is used to execute important code such as closing resources, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not in the `try` block.</p>
