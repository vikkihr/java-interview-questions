            <h2>1. What is the difference between List, Set, and Map in Java?</h2>
            <p>A `List` allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order, while a `Set` does not allow duplicates but does not guarantee order. A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.</p>

            <h2>2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?</h2>
            <p>An `ArrayList` is backed by a dynamic array, whereas a `LinkedList` is backed by a doubly linked list. ArrayList offers constant-time performance for index-based access, while LinkedList is more efficient for insertions and deletions.</p>
