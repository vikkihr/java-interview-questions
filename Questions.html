        <h2>Common Java Interview Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</strong>
                <p>JDK is the Java Development Kit, which includes JRE and development tools like compilers. JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, used to run Java applications, and JVM is the Java Virtual Machine that executes the bytecode.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Explain the concept of inheritance in Java.</strong>
                <p>Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class can inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class. It promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical classification.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?</strong>
                <p>`==` checks reference equality, i.e., if two references point to the same object in memory. `equals()` checks logical equality, i.e., if two objects are semantically equal (based on the values they hold).</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What is the use of the `final` keyword in Java?</strong>
                <p>The `final` keyword in Java is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance. For variables, it means the value cannot be changed once assigned.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Explain the concept of Java garbage collection.</strong>
                <p>Garbage collection in Java is the process by which the JVM automatically deletes objects that are no longer in use (i.e., objects that are no longer reachable) to free up memory.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
